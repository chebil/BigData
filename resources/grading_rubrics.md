## Grade Calculation Example

```
Labs (50%):          85% × 0.50 = 42.5
Capstone (30%):      90% × 0.30 = 27.0
Midterm (10%):       88% × 0.10 = 8.8
Final (10%):         92% × 0.10 = 9.2
Participation (5%):  100% × 0.05 = 5.0
-----------------------------------
Final Grade:                  92.5% (A)
```
