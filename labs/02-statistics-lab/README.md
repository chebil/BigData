# Lab 2: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Perform exploratory data analysis on real datasets
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Visualize distributions
- Conduct hypothesis tests
- Apply probability distributions
- Draw statistical conclusions

## Dataset

We'll use the **Iris dataset** and **Wine Quality dataset** for this lab.

## Lab Structure

- **Part 1**: Descriptive Statistics (30 minutes)
- **Part 2**: Probability Distributions (30 minutes)
- **Part 3**: Hypothesis Testing (40 minutes)
- **Part 4**: Real-World Case Study (50 minutes)

## Prerequisites

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
