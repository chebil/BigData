## ✅ Best Practices

### For Students

1. **Try First**: Attempt exercises before viewing solutions
2. **Run All Cells**: Execute cells in order from top to bottom
3. **Experiment**: Modify code and see what happens
4. **Ask Questions**: Use markdown cells to document your thinking
5. **Save Often**: Notebooks auto-save, but manual saves are recommended

### For Instructors

1. **Clone Notebooks**: Create copies for each semester
2. **Add Notes**: Use markdown cells for additional explanations
3. **Configure nbgrader**: Set up auto-grading (see docs)
4. **Review Outputs**: Check student outputs before grading
5. **Provide Feedback**: Use markdown or code comments

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Kernel Issues
```bash
# Restart kernel
Kernel -> Restart

# Clear all outputs
Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output
```

### Missing Libraries
```bash
# Install in notebook
!pip install package_name

# Or install in environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Slow Performance
- Reduce data size for testing
- Use sampling for large datasets
- Close other notebooks
- Restart kernel periodically
