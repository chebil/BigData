# Phase 3: Model Planning

Model Planning involves selecting appropriate algorithms, defining success metrics, and creating a development strategy.

## Algorithm Selection

Choose algorithms based on:
- Problem type (classification, regression, clustering)
- Data characteristics
- Interpretability requirements
- Performance requirements

## Evaluation Metrics

Define metrics aligned with business goals:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall for classification
- RMSE, MAE, R² for regression
- Silhouette score for clustering

## Development Plan

1. Baseline model
2. Feature selection
3. Model comparison
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Ensemble methods
6. Final model selection
