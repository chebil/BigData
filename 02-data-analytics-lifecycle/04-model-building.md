# Phase 4: Model Building

Model Building is where we train, validate, and optimize machine learning models.

## Training Process

1. **Baseline Model**: Establish performance benchmark
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select features
3. **Cross-Validation**: Ensure model generalizes
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models

## Best Practices

- Use version control for models
- Track experiments systematically
- Document model assumptions
- Validate on holdout set
- Consider computational efficiency
